\chapter{Parallel and Distributed Machine Learning}
\label{ch:bg-parallel-ml}

As the size of the datasets to learn from have grown, so has the need for methods that
can scale and learn from massive data. With the slowdown of CPU frequency
growth, the main avenue for better utilizing modern hardware is to make use
of parallelism, whether that is in a single-worker, or distributed,
making use of a cluster of computers to train models. In this chapter we
will provide an introduction to the systems that make
parallel learning possible and efficient. We start by presenting the
different parallelization paradigms available in Section \ref{sec:bg-ml-paradigms},
continue by presenting the different methods of communicating in
distributed machine learning in Section \ref{sec:bg-ml-communication},
and finish the chapter by highlighting some challenges in
distributed learning in Section \ref{sec:bg-ml-challenges}.
For an in depth look into parallel and distributed Machine Learning (ML)
system design we refer the reader to \cite{distributed-ml-design}.

\section{Parallelization Paradigms}
\label{sec:bg-ml-paradigms}

In an abstract representation of any machine learning problem, we can separate
two functional items: the data, and the model. The data refers to the potentially
massive set of data from which we try to learn, be that a labeled dataset for
supervised learning, or an unlabeled dataset from which we try to extract
structure in unsupervised learning. The model refers to the approximate representation
of the real-world process that we use to encode the information about the world,
through the available data.

These two separate items provide us with a clean separation of how to perform
parallel learning: we can either try to parallelize our learning over the set
of data, known as \emph{data-parallel} learning, or over different parts of
our model, known as \emph{model-parallel} learning. Certain kinds of models
may be more amenable to data or model parallelism. For example, training
linear models using stochastic gradient descent lends itself well to
data-parallel approaches \cite{dekel-optimal-distributed} while random
forest (RF) models allow for easy model-parallel learning,
since every tree in an RF can be grown independently.

Finally, it is also possible to employ data and model parallelism simultaneously,
often referred to as block-parallelism, as done by the Latent Dirichlet Allocation
model of \cite{petuum}.

In our work we employ data-parallel learning for Papers \conceptsicdmNum--\sessionlengthNum,
model-parallel learning for Papers \boostvhtNum and \uncertaintreesNum, and
block-parallel learning for \blockgbt. In the sequel we describe and provide
examples of each learning approach.

\subsection*{Data-parallel Learning}
\label{sec:bg-data-parallel}

Data-parallel learning is the most commonly applied form of parallelism
in machine learning models due to the base assumption of many ML models
that the training data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.)
\cite{distributed-ml-design}. When performing data-parallel training, we
distribute the data over a set of workers, each of which trains the model
on its own partition of the data. At the end of each iteration there is commonly one communication step
to synchronize the models of each worker to avoid diverging models, although
this requirement can be relaxed, for example for asynchronous gradient descent
algorithms like Hogwild \cite{hogwild} or through the use of stale-synchronous
communication~\cite{stale-sync-ps}.

As \citet{distributed-ml-design} note, practically any ML algorithm that makes
the i.i.d. data assumption and has an objective function that sums over
the data indices $i$, can be made into a data-parallel algorithm. As a result,
almost every model available in ML now has multiple data-parallel versions
available. Data-parallel optimization algorithms include stochastic and batch gradient
descent~\cite{dekel-optimal-distributed, parallel-sgd}, L-BFGS~\cite{lbfgs-large-scale, vw},
ADMM~\cite{admm, admm-async}, and coordinate descent~\cite{rendle-distributed-cd, parallel-cd}.
Data-parallel models exist for deep learning~\cite{large-scale-dl}, Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)~\cite{parallel-lda},
gradient boosted trees~\cite{xgboost, lightgbm}, collaborative filtering~\cite{koren-cf, parallel-cf}, Support Vector Machines~\cite{parallel-svm, psvm, parallel-svm-survey}, and Gaussian processes~\cite{gp-big-data, gp-distributed} among others,
see \cite{parallel-ml-book} for a collection of approaches.

\subsection*{Model-parallel Learning}

While developing data-parallel version of existing algorithms is relatively straightforward
due to the i.i.d. assumption, this doesn't apply to model-parallel algorithms. In this
setting, we parallelize the problem by working on different parts of the \emph{model}
in parallel, rather than different partitions of data. The motivation is often
high-dimensional data \cite{parallel-cd-l1}, or
memory limitations: in order to achieve representations
that can learn from massive data, some models, like LDA and deep networks, require
models with up to trillions of parameters \cite{lightLDA, large-scale-dl}
that cannot fit into the memory of one machine or GPU.

The main challenge becomes
that, unlike i.i.d. data, the parameters of most models are dependent on each
other often through an explicit structure like a neural network or Bayesian network, or a
sequential dependence, for example in additive models like gradient boosting \cite{esl}.
Care needs to be taken therefore to ensure that models are kept consistent and do not
diverge due to the limited view of the model each worker possesses.

Commonly, the approach taken is to determine parts of of the model that are indeed
independent and can be optimized in parallel. For example, \citet{parallel-cd-l1}
present a parallel Coordinate Descent algorithm that updates at each iteration
a random number, $P$, of coordinates in parallel. The authors prove that the number of coordinate updates
that can occur in parallel without divergence can be derived from the data and is therefore
highly problem specific. This approach of making use of the \emph{structure} of
the problem to avoid updates that interfere with each other, can also be applied
in other models, see \citet{model-parallel-learning} for a principled approach
to the problem.
Modeling this structure explicitly, Graphlab~\cite{graphlab, graphlab-distributed} presented a learning framework
where models and data are represented in a graph-like structure that can reside in different
nodes and updated in parallel, requiring communication only as the graph structure
indicates. This approach has the limitation however that the models need to be
possible to be represented in a graph structure, something which is not possible
for many categories of algorithms.

Finally, we mention approaches that are both data and model parallel. These are
cases where massive models are needed to be trained over massive datasets, for
example in LDA or deep learning models \cite{large-scale-dl, lightLDA}. This kind of
optimization requires a flexible communication paradigm that allows for efficient
updates of parts of the model that may reside in different workers, from data
that are also distributed. The Parameter Server architecture\cite{muPS} is
allows for such flexible interactions and we describe it in the next
section that focuses on the different communication patterns used
in large-scale ML.

\section{Distributed Communication in Machine Learning}
\label{sec:bg-ml-communication}

Initial distributed ML approaches like parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent
\cite{parallel-sgd} eschewed communication until the very last step of the
algorithm, however as \citet{dekel-optimal-distributed} show, this comes
at a cost of the optimality of the solution. \citet{dekel-optimal-distributed}
instead suggest a method that communicates the gradients for each batch and uses
their average, leading to an asymptotically optimal algorithm for smooth
convex loss functions. What this example demonstrates is the need for communication
in ML models. In this section we will examine some of the approaches for distributed
communication that have been employed in machine learning.

Efficient distributed communication has been a focus in the HPC and distributed systems
communities since their inception, we refer the reader to the monographs
\cite{hpc-intro, distributed-systems-book, distributed-systems-programming, distributed-systems-computation} for thorough introductions.
In the context of machine learning, the focus has been on ways to synchronize
sets of parameters, commonly represented as vectors or matrices, over a network
of computers. The dominant paradigms have been the use of collective communications
like \emph{Allreduce}~\cite{allreduce}, the MapReduce programming paradigm~\cite{mapreduce},
and the Parameter Server~\cite{muPS}.

Allreduce is high-level communication primitive provided by distributed communication
systems like the Message Passing Interface (MPI) protocol \cite{mpi} and the
GPU-targeted NCCL\footnote{\url{https://github.com/NVIDIA/nccl}}. At the highest
level, an allreduce operation on a vector of objects will apply an aggregation
function on the copy of the vector on each worker in a cluster and communicate
the results so that at the end of the operation all workers end up with the same,
aggregated, copy of the vector. As a high level operation there have been
many different implementations suggested for allreduce, like the traditional
binary tree reduction algorithm, ring reduce, and butterfly reduce algorithms~\cite{allreduce}.
The allreduce operation offers developers a simple ``interface'', as what is needed to communicate
the vectors are only the aggregation function, and all workers share the same role.
This simplifies the programming burden significantly, however limits the expressivity
of the algorithm. For algorithms where the computational load cannot be easily divided between
workers, for example the existence of high-frequency words in LDA\cite{lightLDA}, allreduce can result
in imbalances between the workers, leading to increased runtime\cite{straggler-ml, stale-sync-ps}.


The MapReduce programming paradigm \cite{mapreduce} offered some more flexibility in terms of the
programming model, in which the base primitives are a map operation that is applied
locally at each worker on the input, and a reduce operation that aggregates the results
from workers that correspond to the same key. Developers can assign custom partitioners
to have more flexible communication, however the communication pattern is still rigid.
The use of disk-based aggregations for MapReduce are not a good fit for the iterative
nature of most ML algorithms and often leads to increased runtime\cite{distributed-ml-design}.
In-memory data processing systems based on MapReduce-like computation, like Apache Spark \cite{spark}
suffer from similar issues.

A more flexible paradigm is the Parameter Server~\cite{muPS} (PS). In the PS programming
paradigm, machines assume the role of \emph{workers} or \emph{servers}. Workers are
responsible for the computation of parameter changes, for example by iterating through
their local partition of the the data to collect gradient updates. Servers are responsible
for the storage and update of the parameters.
Similarly to a distributed key-value store~\cite{dynamo}, the workers in the PS programming
model have two operations available, \emph{push} that allows them to push a set of
parameters to the servers, and \emph{pull}, that retrieves a set of parameters.
These push and pull operations take as input a \emph{key} that determines
the server that is responsible for that set of parameters, thereby allowing
one-to-one communication between servers and workers.

By allowing the parameters themselves to be
distributed over a cluster of computers, PS allows for intuitive implementation of
model-parallel and block-parallel solutions as exemplified in \cite{muPS, lightLDA}.
The Parameter Server also makes it easier to relax the strict synchronization
barriers that allreduce approaches have, for example by allowing different workers
to work on different iterations of problem, with a bound on the discrepancy between
the fastest and slowest worker that still allows for provable convergence\cite{stale-sync-ps}.

The flexibility of the PS comes at cost of more complex programming on the developer
side, compared to an allreduce operation, as the developer needs to determine the
keys that correspond to the parameters of interest they would like to update or
retrieve. The PS paradigm lends itself very well to cases where updates to the model
are local, i.e. they only touch small parts of the model. This ensures that the communication
necessary for the model updates remains small~\cite{muPS}.

\section{Distributed Learning Challenges}
\label{sec:bg-ml-challenges}

The challenges in distributed learning stem from the need to synchronize the solutions of different workers
after each iteration,
as mentioned in Section \ref{sec:bg-data-parallel}. This model is commonly referred to as
Block Synchronous Parallel (BSP).
In a shared cluster environment a common issue arising is the existence of ``stragglers'', that is,
workers that fall behind in their computation of a particular iteration of an algorithm, causing
the whole system to stall as other workers have to wait for them to finish. Depending on the reliance
of the model on a synchronized solution, this can have more or less adverse effects, see
\cite{straggler-ml} for some more background on the problem and proposed solutions.

The aforementioned Hogwild optimization \cite{hogwild} and to a larger degree the stale-synchronous
parameter server (SSP) \cite{stale-sync-ps} were designed to counter-act the effect of stragglers.
SSP allows for some ``slack'' between the iteration at which different workers can be. In a gradient
descent setting, this would mean that as workers iterate through their partition of the data and move
on to the next iteration, they are allowed to fall behind, such the fastest worker is at most
$s$ iterations ahead of the slowest worker, where $s$ is called the \emph{staleness threshold}.
Unlike asynchronous solutions like Hogwild, \citet{stale-sync-ps} are able to give strong convergence
guarantees for SSP and show how asynchronous algorithms can lead to slow convergence in the presence of stragglers.

Another consideration for the design of distributed learning systems is the
limited network communication available, a problem attenuated in shared clusters,
where many applications are competing for resources, and in cloud environments.
Since network communication is necessary to synchronize the models, creating
communication-efficient algorithms has become a heavily researched area recently,
we refer the reader to \cite{optimization-communication-complexity} for an in-depth
look at the communication costs of distributed learning algorithms.
Systems like the parameter server have been developed with the aim of reducing communication \cite{muPS}
at the systems level,
while specialized algorithms for optimization like CoCoA \cite{cocoa} focus on local computation
in order to reduce the amount of communication necessary. Other approaches include making use
of information theory and codes to speed up learning \cite{distributed-ml-codes} and gradient
compression \cite{gradient-compression}.
In our work on \blockgbt, we take advantage of data sparsity to create efficient representations
and reduce the communication cost distributed gradient boosted tree training by several orders
of magnitude.
