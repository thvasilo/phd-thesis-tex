When preparing my thesis I needed a good template, and really liked the way [Paris Carbone's](https://github.com/senorcarbone) thesis looked, which he was kind enough to share it with me. I think it was originally developed by [Salman Niazi](https://github.com/smkniazi) or its origins lost through KTH history. In any case I hope it help other PhD students looking for a good looking template for KTH.

Original readme follows:

# PhD Thesis Template for Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) Sweden 

It is hard to find PhD thesis template online for KTH in a compilable project form. Here is a template that should just work out of the box.  I have obtained all the classes from the KTH computer support group (http://system.csc.kth.se/misc/tex/) and made a compilable project. 

I have added some personal touches, such as, I have changed the font to Palantino (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palatino) and added microtype (https://www.ctan.org/pkg/microtype?lang=en) latex package. It looks much better now. 

# Compilation

There is a make file included in the project. Run `make` to compile the project. You can also run `make continuous` to live view you changes in the tex files. 


Cheers
